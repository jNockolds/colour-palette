# colour-palette

## Overview

This program allows you to input a colour (or generate a random one) and generate a colour palette of similar colours. It outputs them in the terminal and also with a visual generated by turtle.py.

Note: all function colour parameters should be in hexadecimal in with format "#XXXXXX" (where the Xs are the rgb values).

## Algorithm

The function make_colour_palette essentially treats the three parts of the colour (i.e. r, g, b) as variables and shuffles them around. It then creates a list of all the different combinations. (e.g. input: '#4D80CD', output: ['#4D80CD', '#4DCD80', '#804DCD', '#80CD4D', '#CD4D80', '#CD804D']. 

The function sync_brightness takes each of these colours and compares their apparent brightness to the source colour (in this case '#4D80CD') (it uses the formula $b = \frac{0.299r + 0.587g + 0.114b}{255}$, where $b$ is the brightness $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the colour's rbg values; this is because this is approximately how the human eye weights the brightness of red, green, and blue). It then normalises the other colours in make_colour_palette's array to all have the same brightless as the source colour.
